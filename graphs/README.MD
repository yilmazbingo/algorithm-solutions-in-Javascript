The node in graphs are identical to the node inside of a binary tree. The main difference is in graphs these nodes are called vertices or vertex for singular. The connection is called edge.
These nodes might have multiple connections to multiple nodes.
There is a very high possibility that these nodes can be connected to other nodes and form "cycle". You can have numerous different cycles.

**UNdirected** graph means that we can traverse from any node to any of its corresponding connected nodes.
**Directed** graph means direction that we can traverse is dictated by the direction of the actual arrow that represents the connection. It is possible that in directed graphs arrows can go both ways.

IN both type of graphs there is no cost to traversing across an edge. Because both are unweighted. unweighted means there is no associated weight to any of these edges, whereas a weighted graph does have an associated weight to every edge.

- any undirected graph can be converted into two way directed graph.

- there is also unconnected graph. 

- all binary trees are graphs but opposite is not true.
- all 2d questions are considered a graph question as well. if you visualize a 2d array as a grid, you see that every single grid cell value as vertex and connected to each other.
